# ðŸŸ© #20DaysOfCode 
###### February 2024

Join this challenge and make your GitHub contribution graph greener. This is a lightweight version of a well-known challenge #100DaysOfCode. February has 29 days this year and your goal is to push some code to GitHub for at least 20 days in this month. It leaves a few free days because taking a break from coding can be good sometimes.

**Rules:**
- Push code to GitHub daily for at least **20** days in February.
- Code created at work doesn't count.
- Pushed commit(s) must be in a public repository.
- You can work on your project, code challenges or study with a course.

**Optional:**
- Keep a journal that can be a GitHub repo where you store anything related to the challenge.
- Push code to GitHub every day without a break.
- Separate the changes you make to logical commits as much as possible.
- Write everything in English.
- Choosing one goal for these 20 days is recommended.

There will be a group chat dedicated to this challenge on the Junior Guru Discord server. The purpose of this chat will be to track our progress. It can be used as a simple form of journaling mentioned in optional rules.
