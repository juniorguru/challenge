# üê§ Junior Guru Challenge
This is a project within the Junior Guru club, an active Czechoslovakian community for both beginning and experienced developers on Discord. Each challenge is actually a topic/theme with several project ideas so that any club member can choose the one that best suits their focus and experience level. This repository will contain descriptions of all challenges and links to repositories of individual participants. All communication including challenge updates, feedback sharing and helping each other will take place on the club's Discord server or in the participants' repos. However, even if you aren't in the club, feel free to use the project ideas to practise your dev skills.
