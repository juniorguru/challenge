## 🛠️ Hack Your Way to a New Job
Create something that can help you or/and someone else find a new job. You can choose from the project ideas below or you can come up with something different that fits the focus of this challenge. Don't worry if you like a project idea but it seems difficult. You can make your solution as complex as you want. For example, you don't need a well-designed UI. It can be very simple or even just a console app if you want to focus on other things than the app's appearance. If you're a Junior Guru club member never hesitate to ask a question on our Discord server whether it's about this challenge, your project, or coding and Git/GitHub in general.

### Project Ideas
**🧑‍💻 Portfolio**
- Create your own portfolio where others can learn more about you, your skills and projects
- Or you can make a simple, easily customizable "chicken-folio", a portfolio template for other members of Junior Guru
  
**🪪 Business card/Cover letter generator**
- Web or mobile app where you can input some data and the app creates a good-looking business card containing the information
- It would be cool if the user had the option to send the newly created business card via e-mail or a different, but not mandatory
- Instead of a business card you can create a cover letter generator or something like that

**📊 Job posting scraper/analyzer**
- What about a program that can read job postings, and get and use data from them?
- The app can produce a summary based on the user's settings or even some statistics
- It can be "just" a console app and/or you can create desktop/web/mobile UI as well
- Ideally, something that can make searching for a job easier

**🏢 Free developers listing website**
- You have an imaginary team of developers and you want to offer their time to customers
- It can be just UI with some hardcoded data, you can create a database or you can get data from an external source

**🔎 Job search tracking tool**
- This can be a very handy tool for your (or someone else) job search
- Users would have the possibility to input data about their job search

**🐤 Chickenbook**
- Create an app with a database where people from Junior Guru can sign up and create their profiles
- It can be just a console app or you can also create a good-looking frontend or team up with a frontend developer

**❤️ Show you love it**
- Choose a company/app you love and make a simplified copy of their app/solution
- Instead of a copy you can create something close to their focus, or a feature you'd like to see from them
